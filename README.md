🚀 **New Project Alert!** 🎯

I just built an **Interactive Pricing Component** as part of my frontend development journey! 💻✨
This sleek UI component allows users to **dynamically adjust pricing plans** based on usage tiers — think sliders, real-time updates, and smooth transitions 🔥

🔧 **Tech Stack:**
HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Responsive Design

💡 **Key Features:**
✅ Real-time price updates based on slider input
✅ Toggle for monthly/yearly billing
✅ Clean, responsive UI with animations
✅ Built for performance and user experience

This was a fun and valuable deep-dive into DOM manipulation, UI/UX principles, and component-based architecture. Great practice for real-world SaaS dashboards! 🧠📈
